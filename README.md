# Job Role Analyser
This tool is a way for me to find the correlation between what employers want and what I can offer. Taking requirements from job posts in LinkedIn and then matching key ('buzz') words with my skills. I'm looking to visual this data in matplotlib/seaborn so pandas is on the cards also.
